Repeating
    I found that Controller class has actionPerformed which has many same checking selected JCheckBox. I decided to divide
    this part to new method called modelCheck which input arraylist of JCheckBox to make it easy to check selected JCheck
    and can input more JCheckBox. Moreover in the same class, Image_Panel inner class has Image_Panel method which has the
    same process of input and output image, so I decided to divide the same process to new method to manage image layout by
    passing JLabel. That mean I found and build new method to check or do and loop to do.
Long method
    There have long method which are too many lines of code that are easier to write code than to read. The long method is
    hard to read and find error if it has any error. So I decided to extract method to small method in each inner class.
    In Controller class, actionPerformed method is too long that I extract to 2 method to support it consist mange text file
    and model check and DecodeButton inner class has actionPerformed method which is also too long, so I extract this method
    to do text file method and message method. Moreover, View class has long method too which is Encode_Panel inner class
    having Encode_Panel method that mange JPanel box, so I decided to extract them to smaller method to mange the layout of
    each JPanel box and call them in Encode_Panel method. Decode_Panel inner class has Decode_Panel metod is too long method
    which extract encodeButton and JTextArea layout method to manage each layout.
